For this program to work you will need to create and fill out a file named **private/db_credentials.php** using the following code below.

```
<?php 
  define("DB_SERVER", "SERVER NAME");
  define("DB_USER", "USER NAME");
  define("DB_PASS", "PASSWORD");
  define("DB_NAME", "DATABASE NAME");
?>
```

You will also need to download the **salamanders.sql** file and run the code.
